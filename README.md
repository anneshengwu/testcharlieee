As you complete each step, this README will automatically update to show the next task. Follow along to learn advanced GitHub Projects automation step by step.

## Step 1: Create a Project Board with Custom Fields
Let's start by creating a project board with fields designed for automation.

### üìã Task: Create a Project with Custom Fields
1. Go to the "Projects" tab at the top of this repository
2. Click "Create project"
3. Select "Board" as the template
4. Name your project "Automated Workflow"
5. Click "Create"
6. Add the following custom fields:
   - "Status" as a "Single select" with options: Backlog, In Progress, Under Review, Completed
   - "Priority" as a "Single select" with options: Low, Medium, High, Critical
   - "Due Date" as a "Date" field
   - "Effort" as a "Number" field
   - "Assignee" as a "Person" field

Once completed, go to the **Actions** tab and run the "Complete Step 1" workflow to proceed to the next step.

### üìö Why Custom Fields Matter for Automation
Custom fields act as triggers and conditions for automations. Well-structured fields make it possible to create powerful, targeted workflows that update automatically based on specific conditions or events.
